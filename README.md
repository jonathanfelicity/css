# Responsive Design

## viewport
is a user visibility area.

## setting view port

Take control over the viewport through the <meta> tag
```html
<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">

```
The _width=device-width_ part sets the width of the page to follow the screen-width of the device (which will vary depending on the device).

The _initial-scale=1.0_ part sets the initial zoom level when the page is first loaded by the browser.
